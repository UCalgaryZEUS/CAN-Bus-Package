= CANBus Package README

== Overview
The purpose of this README is to act as a brief reference for the process used in revision control. 
It walks the user through the steps starting from the inital fork to the final pull request.

== How To Use Repository
== Initial First Time Steps
. Perform a fork of the CAN-Bus-Package repo on github.
. Clone the fork onto your machine.
+
`git clone https://github.com/UCalgaryZEUS/CAN-Bus-Package.git`

. Remote add the upstream repository.
+
`git remote add ZEUS https://github.com/UCalgaryZEUS/CAN-Bus-Package.git`

== Adding Content to Repo
=== Keeping Updated with ZEUS master
Periodically, these steps will have to be run to ensure that your master is up to date with ZEUS' master. 

IMPORTANT: NEVER do any work on your local master; this will cause merge conflicts.

. `git checkout master`

. `git fetch ZEUS`

. `git rebase ZEUS/master`

. `git push origin master`
+
NOTE: The previous step is for making your remote fork is up to date.

. `git checkout -b new-branch`
+
NOTE: This step will create a new branch for you to work on issues or create content with.

=== Pushing Content
These steps are used to push work done on your local repository to your remote one.
. `git add files`

. `git commit -m "issue description and work done"`

. `git push origin new-branch`
NOTE: After the first push to origin new-branch, you only need to use `git push` to push it to origin new-branch

=== Pull Requests
When you are ready to perform a pull request, go onto github and create a pull request appropriately setting somebody as the assignee.
